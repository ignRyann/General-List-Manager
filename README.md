# General List Manager

##### [1. Decsription](#description)

## Description
The General List Manager is a program, written in Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, that completes all the requirements set for UCL COMP0005 : Object-Oriented Programming Coursework 3. The requirements were set out as the following:

### {
The program is for storing, searching and viewing lists of information, essentially a general list making application. While this is implemented as a web application assume it is for your own personal use and only accessible by yourself, so no user management or logging on is required. The data should be stored in files, you decided the fomat.

The user interface should be implemented as web pages viewed in a web browser, using standard HTML and CSS. You don't need to implement a sophisticated user interface, or start using CSS libraries like Bootstrap - this module is primarily about Java programming, not creating complex front-ends for web applications! Don't get side-side tracked in to spending too much time on the appearance of web pages.

It is up to you to interpret the requirement and decide the details of what you actually implement.

#### Requirement 1.
The program can store one or more lists of items. Each list has a name or label, and items might include text, an URL, an image, some other kind of data, or a combination of these such as an item with text and an image.

#### Requirement 2.
An item in a list can be a link to another list of items, making it possible to have lists of lists.

#### Requirement 3.
Item lists can be created, deleted, removed, or edited. An item can be a link to another list.

#### Requirement 4.
Items in a list can be added, removed, or edited. An item can be a link to another list.

#### Requirement 5.
One, multiple or all item lists can be searched and lists can be located by searching for the name of the list.

#### Requirement 6.
A list is automatically saved to a file in some format (you decide), so that the user does not have to explicitly load or save to a file. When a list or items are modified, the change(s) are immediately written to the file.

## List Manager Breakdown

## The Home Page
When launching the General List Manager, it displays the navigation bar, the landing screen as well as the footer. The landing screen showcases the specifications for the coursework as well as an aesthetic background. The footer links to my Github page and the navigation bar consists of 3 items; Home, View All Lists, Search.
##### Home
The 'Home' menu button leads to the home page and is way for the user to return to the start.
##### View All Lists
This forwards the user to the dashboard where they can edit the data
##### Search
The user is able to search for an item within the chosen lists.
